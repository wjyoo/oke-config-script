# kube_setup.sh
> This script requires oci script invoking in advance. Before executing this script, you should execute oci script.

This script creates ./kube/config file invoking oci script(oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig).
This script doesn't include making kubernetes cluster, so you have to prepare kubernetes cluster by hand in advance for now.
This script include below.
1. Writing to config file of kubernetes cluster information
2. Creating kubernetes secret for OCIR
3. git config setup : This is used for ci/cd lab
4. make kubeproxy alias : This is for kubernetes dashboard per user

# prepareapp.sh
This script is for copying files below to each users.
```
cloud-native-oke.tar
mysql-deployment.yaml
```

# getalltokens.sh
This file is for the gathering of all users' auth_token file.
auth_token files are generated by oci script.
